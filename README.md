# AP YOUTUBE TERM PROJECT
### (I couldn't think of like a joke name.... )



## Description

A simple Java Desktop application for sharing videos... with the people connected to your local host.

## Features
You can create multiple accounts and upload videos and see other peoples accounts and watch videos and comment (I mean its yt thats all it does) oh and you used to be able to make playlists but Idk what I did but that  no work no more :3

## More detailed explanation in regard to the code architecture... you nerds

The program is built around two simple main Classes, the GUI class and the CCM or Central Class Management class.
The GUI hold the panels (such as video, channel and much more) and their respected functions.
And the CCM houses the instances of the main classes and their data such as an array list of the three main classes and one instance of each.
On the Server and Client side it is much simpler, the Server is connected (or is supposed to be connected since as the time of writing this the database has not been finished yet >:[  ) to the database and each client sends a request to receive the required array lists or add a new one.
And the client can also send videos and receive them from the Server by using the functions in the Client Class.
